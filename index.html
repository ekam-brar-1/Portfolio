            <h2> How it feels like an international student?</h2>
            <p>As an international student, the experience is a rollercoaster of emotions and challenges. Excitement surges through your veins as you step into a new country, eager to immerse yourself in its culture. Yet, there's an underlying nervousness, feeling like you're navigating uncharted territory. The language barrier adds another layer of complexity, every conversation a delicate dance of words. Academically, the unfamiliarity of the education system presents challenges, but overcoming them brings a sense of accomplishment. Homesickness lingers in the background, a subtle ache for the comforts of home. Despite the hurdles, there's profound growth and resilience. Each obstacle overcome, each new experience embraced, adds another layer to your identity. The opportunity to study abroad is treasured, a chance to broaden horizons and see the world in a new light. Amidst the highs and lows, there's an exhilarationâ€”a feeling of being part of something bigger, something extraordinary. Being an international student is a journey of self-discovery, resilience, and appreciation for the rich tapestry of the world.</p>
            <h2>What are my future expectations?</h2>
            <p>In the evolving landscape of software development, expectations center around adaptability, continual learning, and specialized expertise. Developers are required to stay updated with emerging technologies, emphasizing lifelong learning to remain competitive. Specialization in areas like artificial intelligence, cybersecurity, and data science is increasingly sought after, reflecting the complexity of modern software systems. Collaboration and cross-disciplinary skills are crucial as developers work in multidisciplinary teams to solve complex problems. Additionally, there's a growing emphasis on user experience, security, and ethical considerations. Developers are expected to prioritize usability, integrate robust security measures, and adhere to ethical guidelines to ensure responsible development. Agile methodologies and DevOps practices are standard, enabling rapid iteration and delivery of high-quality software. As remote work becomes more prevalent, proficiency in collaboration tools and remote communication is essential. Overall, the future of software development demands a versatile skill set, a commitment to innovation, and a focus on ethical and user-centric practices within a dynamic technological landscape.</p>
